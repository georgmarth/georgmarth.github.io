# About Me

Hi, I'm Georg Marth, a Unity and general game programmer from Berlin. I made this site to present myself and my work. I studied computer science in Magdeburg for three years. Later I went to GPB Berlin to learn game design and game specific programming.

These are some projects that I worked on by myself or at school.

I created this game for my intermediate exam at GPB Berlin.

# Personal 

Although I am foremost a programmer, I have an interest in many different fields and disciplines.  
I can do 3D modeling in Blender3D and know my way around Photoshop and Substance Painter. I also have experience recording and mixing audio with professional hardware.  
I play the violin, guitar and bass as a hobby and used to do so professionally in a folk band.
